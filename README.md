# Getting Started 🚀
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adithya17-star/startup-copilot.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd startup-copilot
```
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Next, you need to install the required dependencies. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install all the necessary libraries and tools for the project.

Step 3: Run the Development Server
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the app, and you should see output similar to this:

arduino
Copy
Edit
  VITE v2.7.10  ready in 300ms

  VITE v2.7.10  ready in 300ms
  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use `--host` to expose
Open http://localhost:5173/ in your browser to see the app running locally.

Step 4: Make Changes
You can now make edits to the code. Any changes you make will be automatically reflected in the browser. For example, you can edit the src/App.tsx file to see changes live.

Step 5: Build for Production
When you're ready to deploy the app, you can build it for production by running:

```bash
npm run build
```
This will create an optimized build in the dist/ folder, which can be deployed to your preferred hosting platform.
