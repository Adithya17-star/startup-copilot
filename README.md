bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/startup-copilot.git
cd startup-copilot
✅ 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js installed (version 18+ recommended). Then run:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
This installs all the packages listed in package.json.

✅ 3. Start the Development Server
bash

Open that URL in your browser to view your app.
